#Flaskula

This is an app following the tutorial in Miguel Grinberg's "Flask Web Development" book.

## Environment variables

This requires certain environment variables to be set.  So far these include:

- MAIL_USERNAME
- MAIL_PASSWORD
- FLASKULA_ADMIN

## Requirements

Database *write* doesn't seem to work under Python 2.  Use Python 3.  
I used Python 3.4.0 for testing and 3.5.0 for production on Heroku.
